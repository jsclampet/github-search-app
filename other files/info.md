## Github Search App

-Github API:    https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/users#get-a-user 

## The Plan

[MobileFirst](375x777px)
-Light Mode
-Dark Mode

**Structure**
-HTML first
-CSS next
-JS last
-Could try outer to inner approach

[HTML-first]
-Main Container for uniform width
-Heading div with light/dark switch
-Header container (search), input with search btn
-User Info container with:
-- User-Profile div to show pic, name, tag, date joined
-- Paragraph underneath (relevant info, maybe status?)
-- follower div to show Repos Followers Following
-- contact div to show location, blog, twitter, github tag

[CSS-next]
-specify 'darkmode' classes
-Mobile First
-Show location, github blog, twitter, github tag

[JS-last]
-Dynamic data sections:
--Dark/light button
--Search field
--User profile Div (pic || name, tag, joined)

## Colors 

[LightMode]
-#0079FF  (bright blue)
-#697C9A  (grayish)
-#4B6A9B (gray blue)
-#2B3442 (dark gray / light black)
-#F6F8FF (white blue)
-#FEFEFE (white)

[DarkMode]
-#0079FF  (bright blue)
-#FFFFFF (whitest white)
-#141D2F (Light Black)
-#1E2A47 (gray)



## Expected behaviour

- On first load, show the profile information for Octocat.
- Display an error message (as shown in the design) if no user is found when a new search is made.
- If a GitHub user hasn't added their name, show their username where the name would be without the `@` symbol and again below with the `@` symbol.
- If a GitHub user's bio is empty, show the text "This profile has no bio" with transparency added (as shown in the design). The lorem ipsum text in the designs shows how the bio should look when it is present.
- If any of the location, website, twitter, or company properties are empty, show the text "Not Available" with transparency added (as shown in the design).
- Website, twitter, and company information should all be links to those resaources. For the company link, it should remove the `@` symbol and link to the company page on GitHub. For Octocat, with `@github` being returned for the company, this would lead to a URL of `https://github.com/github`.







## What I've Learned

- A little bit about the 'Date' object in JS (new Date())

- A little bit about Date formatting 
- - https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_date_formats.asp
- - https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_string.asp 
- - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1643320/get-month-name-from-date
- - https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/javascript/javascript+date+format+from+api

- JS error 'Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier ... has already been declared ...' 
- - https://exerror.com/uncaught-syntaxerror-identifier-a-has-already-been-declared/

- Creative use of ternary operator (example below)
- - twitter.innerHTML = (githubApi.twitter_username ? githubApi.twitter_username : `<p style="color:red;">"Not Available"</p>`) 
- - I've set the innerHTML of the twitter element/object to be 1 of 2 different choices, pending if the API key:value was present (not null)

- To get user-entered text of input, you can user the value method on the object (object.value)

- Use classes as UTILITY to make it easier to toggle between dark/light in JS

- Different use-cases for JS property "classList", with different methods
- - classList.toggle is extremely useful (on/off)
- - classList.contains is extremely useful to check if js object/var/element contains a class by name 

- querySelector() methodcan only be used to access a single element while querySelectorAll() method can be used to access all elements which match with a specified CSS selector (was having issue with light btn and dark btn with using just selector, since it selected only one (the first instance))
- - However! querySelectorAll creates a 'nodeCollection', which is different and more limited than an Array. Therefore, could not use .forEach method, went with a basic forloop when creating event listener, and referenced each modeSwitch item via index (i)

- Applied user order in order to switch up .user-info container 

- {overflow: hidden} --- this CSS property got rid of the scroll bar and scrolling. Scrolling was most-likely due to {body: 100vh} AND margin-top from first child element
